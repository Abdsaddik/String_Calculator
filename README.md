This program parses arithmetic input **(only addition and substraction)** from terminal and calculate the result. 

- The user types the string in the terminal
- The program reads the input and  prints the result
- The user can organise his string in parentheses. But if the number of parentheses is not correct the program refuses the input
- Spaces between the numbers are allowed
